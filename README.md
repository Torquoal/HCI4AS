The aim of the project is to create an application, used on a smartphone, to help
people to take correctly their pills and medication. A patient will configurate
the application with his medical treatment and then the application will remind
and notify him to take his pills, how to take them, with food or water, and
whether the amount left is low.

This repository contains:
* Semi-Functional Prototype for MediClock
* contribution of each team member

The application is only a semi-Functional Prototype, featuring some simulated
behaviour bispoke to a Summative Evaluation. The library Annyang  is used for
Voice Recognition and several previous implementations of elements, such as the
clock, that have been tweaked or changed to better suit this application.
