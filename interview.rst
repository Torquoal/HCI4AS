Annexe A: Interview
===================

Annexe A.1: Questions
---------------------
**Interlude**: We are designing an application to make pill usage easier. I am
going to pitch some of the ideas we have to you, please let me know if you think
they would be useful to you or others whom the app would be applicable for.

1.How many pills/types do you currently take daily?

2.Do you find keeping track of your pills sometimes challenging? Why?

3.How do you currently keep track of when and how to take your pills? What are
the advantages and disadvantages of your current method? *INTERLUDE HERE*

4.Alarms to take your pills, where the pill and its needs are spoken with a voice
synthesizer.

5.The ability to turn off the alarm when started with a voice command.

6.An interface which displays the pills you need to take around the face of an
analogue clock face.

7.The ability to add conditions to your pills such as water, food allowance etc.

8.A next of kin automatic message if a pill is missed.

9.Health information about the pills and advice on how to take them when pressed
or when a reminder triggers.

10.Alarm vibration in case the environment is too noisy to hear it.

11.The ability to add whole packets of pills to the application, so it can count
down how many you have remaining and notify you of a need to replace them.

12.Thank you or your time, are there any further comments, suggestions or concerns
you would like to voice in regard to this application design?

Annexe A.2: Interview 1
-----------------------
1.It depends, I take birth control for 21 days on, 7 off. Otherwise I take 11 a
day, of 5 different types. 6 in the morning, 1 in the afternoon and 4 in the evening.

2.Yes, such as where they are, in several boxes or locations and the quantities
left. It is difficult when I am taking painkillers during my period, so I have to
fiddle with settings to have pills available on some days, as the app i am currently
using does not allow custom intervals.

3.Medisafe App: Provides reminders with a small sound effect, has a snooze function,
takes note of if your pills are taken, reminds which pills to pack in the morning.

4.I would not find that helpful, I prefer to read the instructions and my pills
do not require specific instructions. I also do not like voice synthesizer much.

5.I think that is useful. Sometimes I have a trouble getting to my phone quickly
or am having coordination issues.

6.Seems like a cool idea, although unsure how it might be more useful than simple
morning, afternoon, evening labels as MediSafe currently has.

7.It is not applicable to my pill requirements.

8.Would be useful if I could toggle for more crucial pills etc.

9.I would enjoy that feature although. Sidenote please have notifications appear
on the top of the screen, as this is convention across android and iOS.

10.Yes, current app uses this and it's often really helpful.

11.This could be really useful, especially if the pills were shown in terms of
strips left, as sometimes just one large number is not super easy to plan around.

12.Itâ€™s very important that it always runs in the background, and should be
whitelisted from app-killing applications/battery savers.

Annexe A.2: Interview 2
-----------------------
1.variable - it's all stuff on an as-needed basis, mostly pain meds, maybe 6 a
day average.

2.can be challenging because it's not a regular routine, general advice is to
only use pain meds when needed and occasionally I'll try to go a week or so without
them to avoid building up too much tolerance

3.ibuprofen and codeine both require 4 hours between doses.  my physio told me
the best angle is taking ibuprofen at X, codeine at X+2, ibuprofen at X+4, etc.
so there's always something in effect. it's difficult to remember what the last
one I took was and when, never quite get the 2-hour thing right if I'm busy. I
found regular stuff like antidepressants easier to keep track of when I was on
those because I could just take them before bed or when I got up

4.alarms would work if I can set a relatively quiet volume, but I'm not a fan
of med stuff being spoken since I'm out and about most days. mute push notifications
would be great.

5.wouldn't use it myself because my accent never seems to be recognised by most
APIs

6.sounds great for meds with regular schedules, not sure how it'd work for stuff
I don't know if I'll need to take or not. Interviewer: so, for your schedule because
it kind of leads on dynamically to be helpful it would need to place pills the correct
time behind each other. Interviewee: yeah, that'd be great if it set them at X interval
within certain time boundaries (probably won't need to take them past 11pm, etc.)

7.yeah, that's a good idea

8.some of them are nasty if you forget to eat

9.sure, could be useful for people taking a wide range of meds or getting used
to new ones

10.please don't call my dad because I missed an ibuprofen. like for older patients
or maybe chemo meds or something, sure.

11.I use vibrate alerts for a lot of things anyway, so yeah, that'd be ideal

12.would be really helpful. especially for over the counter stuff like ibuprofen
where you can just go and buy it without needing appointments.

13.No, it's all good.
